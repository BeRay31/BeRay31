## Hi, I'm Rey <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="3%">
👋 Hey there! I'm a creative problem-solver with a knack for crafting solutions that make an impact. From front-end wizardry to cloud cost-saving sorcery, I've done it all! 💻✨

At GoPay, I helped launch a cloud cost dashboard that saved the company up to 30% in cloud expenses — now that's what I call budget magic! 🧙‍♂️💸 I’ve also dabbled in machine learning, developing a category auto-inferencing system to give our internal ticketing system a boost. 🎟️🤖

When I’m not slashing cloud costs, you can find me optimizing cron jobs like a concurrency programming ninja (90% faster, anyone? ⚡). I love solving problems and have been around LeetCode, ranking in the top 6% globally. Always up for a challenge, always learning, and always aiming to build things that matter.

Let’s build something cool together! 🚀
